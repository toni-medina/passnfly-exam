# passnfly-exam

This is an `IntelliJ` project built to implement the `Passnfly` exam.

The exam has 3 questions and this project covers two of them.

**Question 1 - Booking (Done!)**
The test can be found in "BookingPageTest.java" and the results are printed on log console.

**Question2 - Download PDF files (Done!)**
The test can be found in "FileExamplesPageTest.java" and the location where files are downloaded can be changed editing "config.properties" file.

**Question3 - Distil blockage (WIP!)**
This question has not been implemented. I've found some links with useful information about this problem, but it is necessary a lot of investigation work to be done in order to implement the right solution. No time for more.
